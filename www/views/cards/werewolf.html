    <h3>The Simple Werewolf</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of the werewolves is to eliminate the other inhabitants of the
        village by devouring a villager each night. During the day, they hide
        their nocturnal identities to avoid being lynched. Under no circumstances
        can a simple werewolf devour another werewolf.
