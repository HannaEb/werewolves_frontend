    <h3>The Big Bad Wolf</h3>
      <p>
        Every night the big bad wolf wakes up and devours with all the other
        werewolves. But long as no werewolf, wild child or wolf hound has been
        eliminated during the game, he will wake up a second time and devour a
        second victim. The big bad wolf cannot devour another werewolf.
