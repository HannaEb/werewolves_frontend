    <h3>The Angel</h3>
      <p>
        The game begins with a village vote rather than the first night. The
        angel's aim is to get eliminated either in the vote or killed by the
        werewolves in the first round. If he succeeds, he wins and the game is
        over immediately. If he survives, the angel must continue the rest of
        the game as a villager.
