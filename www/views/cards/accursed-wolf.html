    <h3>The Accursed Wolf-Father</h3>
      <p>
        Every night the accursed wolf-father wakes up and devours with the other
        werewolves. But once per game, after the werewolves have devoured
        someone, he raises his hand to mean that the victim hasnâ€™t been
        devoured, but infected. The infected victim then immediately and
        secretly becomes a werewolf.
