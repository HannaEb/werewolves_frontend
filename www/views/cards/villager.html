    <h3>The Simple Villager</h3>
      <p>
        The most commonplace role, a simple Villager spends the game trying
        to root out who they believe the werewolves (and other villagers) are.
        While they do not need to lie, the role requires players to keenly sense
        and point out the flaws or mistakes of their fellow players. Someone is
        speaking too much? Could mean they're a werewolf. Someone isn't speaking
        enough? Could mean the same thing. It all depends on the people you're
        playing with, and how well you know them.
